# Linear-Regression
This project aims to predict the median value of homes in Boston using linear regression techniques on the Boston Housing Dataset. The project includes exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and implementation of two linear regression models: Closed Form Linear Regression and Linear Regression using Gradient Descent. The analysis involves preprocessing the data, visualizing key features, and evaluating model performance.
